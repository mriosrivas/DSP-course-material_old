    "# Digital Filters\n",
    "In this part we will introduce the two types of digital filters and how the z-transform is used for calculating their frequency response, and their zeros and poles.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Z-Transform\n",
    "\n",
    "Just as analog filters are designed using the Laplace transform, recursive digital filters are developed with a parallel technique called the z-transform. The overall strategy of these two transforms is the same: probe the impulse response with sinusoids and exponentials to find the system's poles and zeros. The Laplace transform deals with differential equations, the s-domain, and the s-plane. Correspondingly, the z-transform deals with difference equations, the z-domain, and the z-plane. However, the two techniques are not a mirror image of each other; the s-plane is arranged in a rectangular coordinate system, while the z-plane uses a polar format. \n",
    "\n",
    "The standard form of the z-transform is given by:\n",
    "$$X(z) = \\sum \\limits^{\\infty}_{n=-\\infty} x[n]z^{-n} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $z=re^{j\\omega}$ and $r=e^{\\sigma}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The utility to have the z-transform resides in the implementation of recursive filters, which uses *recursion coefficients*. To analyze these systems in the z-domain, we must be able to convert these recursion coefficients into the z-domain *transfer function*, and back again. Defining the z-transform in this manner ($r^n$ and $z$) provides the simplest means of moving between these two important representations. In fact, defining the z-domain in this way makes it trivial to move from one representation to the other."

    "## Stability and Relation with the Fourier Transform\n",
    "\n",
    "In a continous system, if a pole occupies the right half of the s-plane (by the use of the Laplace transform) the system will be unstable. In the case of a discrete system, the system will be unstable if the poles are outside the unit circle in the z-plane. When the time domain signal is completly real, the upper and lower halves of the z-plane are mirror images of each other, just as with the s-domain.\n",
    "\n",
    "A continous sinusoid can have any frequency between DC and infinity, a discrete sinusoid can only have a frequency between DC and one-half of the sampling rate. That is, frequency must be between 0 and 0.5, or between 0 and $\\pi$ when expressed as a natural frequency.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Laplace transform, evaluated at $\\sigma = 0$, is equal to the Fourier transform. Evaluating the z-transform at $r=1$ is equal to the Discrete Time Fourier Transform (DTFT)."

    "The impulse response or the frequency response classify digital filters. If the impulse response of the filter falls to zero after a finite period of time, it is an FIR (Finite Impulse Response) filter. However, if the impulse response exists indefinitely, it is an IIR (Infinite Impulse Response) filter. How the output values are calculated determines whether the impulse response of a digital filter falls to zero after a finite period of time. For FIR filters the output values depend on the current and the previous input values, whereas for IIR filters the output values also depend on the previous output values.\n",
