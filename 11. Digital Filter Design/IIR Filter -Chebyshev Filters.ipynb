    "# IIR Filter -Chebyshev Filters\n",
    "\n",
    "Chebyshev filters are used to separate one band of frequencies from another. Although they cannot match the performance of the windowed-sinc filter, they are more than adequate for many applications. The primary attribute of Chebyshev filters is their speed, typically more than an order of magnitude faster than the windowed-sinc. This is because they are carried out by recursion rather than convolution. The design of these filters is based on the z-transform.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Chebyshev and Butterworth Responses\n",
    "The Chebyshev response is a mathematical strategy for achieving a faster roll-off by allowing ripple in the frequency response. Analog and digital filters that use this approach are called Chebyshev filters. These filters are named from their use of the Chebyshev polynomials, developed by the Russian mathematician Pafnuti Chebyshev (1821-1894).\n",
    "\n",
    "The Figure shows the frequency response of low-pass Chebyshev filters with passband ripples of: 0%, 0.5% and 20%. As the ripple increases (bad), the roll-off becomes sharper (good). The Chebyshev response is an optimal trade-off between these two parameters. When the ripple is set to 0%, the filter is called a maximally flat or Butterworth filter (after S. Butterworth, a British engineer who described this response in 1930). A ripple of 0.5% is a often good choice for digital filters. This matches the typical precision and accuracy of the analog electronics that the signal has passed through.\n",
