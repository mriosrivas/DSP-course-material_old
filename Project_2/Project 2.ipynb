    "### Create a reflected FM chirp signal\n",
    "A chirp is a signal in which the frequency increases (up-chirp) or decreases (down-chirp) with time. It is commonly applied to sonar, radar, and laser systems, and to other applications, such as in spread-spectrum communications.\n",
    "\n",
    "In spread-spectrum usage, surface acoustic wave (SAW) devices are often used to generate and demodulate the chirped signals. In optics, ultrashort laser pulses also exhibit chirp, which, in optical transmission systems, interacts with the dispersion properties of the materials, increasing or decreasing total pulse dispersion as the signal propagates. The name is a reference to the chirping sound made by birds. \n",

    "In this part two task are described:\n",
    "1. How to create a linear FM swept-frequency cosine chirp signal?\n",
    "2. How to model the received sonar signal? \n",

    "\n",

    "We can model our received sonar chirp signal $\\hat{x}(t)$ as modified version of the original signal $x(t)$ as follows:\n",
