    "# Discrete Fourier Transform\n",
    "Fourier analysis is a family of mathematical techniques, all based on decomposing signals into sinusoids. The Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) is the family member used with digitized signals. In this notebook we focus on the real DFT, a version of the discrete Fourier transform that uses real numbers to represent the input and output signals. \n",
    "\n",
    "The Discrete Fourier Transform, DFT, changes an N point input signal into two point output signals. The input signal contains the signal being decomposed, while the two output signals contain the amplitudes of the component sine and cosine waves. The input signal is said to be in the time domain and the output signal in the frequency domain.\n",
    "\n",
    "The frequency domain contains exactly the same information as the time domain, just in a different form. If you know one domain, you can calculate the other. Given the time domain signal, the process of calculating the frequency domain is called **decomposition**, **analysis**, the **forward DFT**, or simply, the **DFT**. If you know the frequency domain, calculation of the time domain is called **synthesis**, or the **inverse DFT**. \n",
    "\n",
    "The number of samples in the time domain is usually represented by the variable $N$. While $N$ can be any positive integer, a power of two is usually chosen, i.e., 128, 256, 512, 1024, etc. There are two reasons for this. First, digital data storage uses binary addressing, making powers of two a natural signal length. Second, the most efficient algorithm for calculating the DFT, the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT), usually operates with $N$ that is a power of two. Typically, $N$ is selected between 32 and 4096. In most cases, the samples run from $0$ to $N-1$, rather than $1$ to $N$. \n",
    "\n",
    "Time domain signals usually uses lower cases notation and frequency domain signals uses upper case notation, therefore a signal $x[n]$ said to be in the time domain and $X[n]$ is in the frequency domain. The frequency domain signal $X[n]$ consists of two parts, each of $N/2 +1$ samples. These are called the **Real** part of $X[ ]$ , written as: $\\mathbf{Re}X[n]$, and the **Imaginary** part of $X[ ]$, written as: $\\mathbf{Im}X[ ]$. The values in $\\mathbf{Re}X[ ]$ are the amplitudes of the cosine waves, while the values in $\\mathbf{Im}X[ ]$ are the amplitudes of the sine waves. Just as the time domain runs from $x[n]$ to $x[N-1]$, the frequency domain signals run from $\\mathbf{Re}X[0]$ to $\\mathbf{Re}X[N/2]$, and from $\\mathbf{Im}X[0]$ to $\\mathbf{Im}X[N/2]$."

    "### Polar Nuisances\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Nuisance 1: Radians vs. Degrees\n",
    "It is possible to express the phase in either degrees or radians. When expressed in degrees, the values in the phase signal are between -180 and 180. Using radians, each of the values will be between $-\\pi$ and $\\pi$.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Nuisance 2: Divide by zero error\n",
    "When converting from rectangular to polar notation, it is very common to find frequencies where the real part is zero and the imaginary part is some nonzero value. This simply means that the phase is exactly 90 or -90 degrees. To avoid this problem, the real part must be tested for being zero before the division. If it is zero, the imaginary part must be tested for being positive or negative, to determine whether to set the phase to $\\pi /2$ or $-\\pi /2$, respectively. Lastly, the division just needs to be bypassed.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Nuisance 3: Incorrect arctan\n",
    "This error occurs whenever the real part is negative. This problem can be corrected by testing the real and imaginary parts after the phase has been calculated. If both the real and imaginary parts are negative, subtract 180 (or $\\pi$ radians) from the calculated phase. If the real part is negative and the imaginary part is positive, add 180 (or $\\pi$ radians).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Nuisance 4: Phase of very small magnitudes\n",
    "If the magnitude is negligibly small, the phase doesn't have any meaning, and can assume unusual values.\n",
    "![Phase of a small magnitude signal](Images/nuisance4.gif)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Nuisance 5: $2\\pi$ ambiguity of the phase\n",
    "Every time a point looks as if it is going to dip below $-\\pi$, it snaps back to $\\pi$. This is a result of the periodic nature of sinusoids. For example, a phase shift of $\\theta$, is exactly the same as a phase shift of $\\theta + 2\\pi$, $\\theta + 4\\pi$, $\\theta + 6\\pi$, etc. Any sinusoid is unchanged when you add an integer multiple of $2\\pi$ to the phase. The apparent discontinuities in the signal are a result of the computer algorithm picking its favorite choice from an infinite number of equivalent possibilities. The smallest possible value is always chosen, keeping the phase between $-\\pi$ and $\\pi$. Sometimes is good to solve this issue by implementing a technique called **unwrapping the phase** which extends the phase above $\\pi$ or below $-\\pi$. The idea behind this algorithm is as follows: a multiple of $2\\pi$ is added or subtracted from each value of the phase based on a minimization of the difference between adjacent samples.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Nuisance 6: The magnitude is always positive ($\\pi$ ambiguity of the phase)\n",
    "The following figure shows a frequency domain signal in rectangular and polar form. The real part is smooth and quite easy to understand, while the imaginary part is entirely zero. In comparison, the polar signals contain abrupt discontinuities and sharp corners. This is because the magnitude must always be positive, by *definition*. Whenever the real part dips below zero, the magnitude remains positive by changing the phase by $\\pi$ (or $-\\pi$, which is the same thing).\n",
    "\n",
    "![Rectangular and polar form of a signal](Images/nuisance6.gif)\n",
    "\n",
    "One solution is to allow the magnitude to have negative values while the phase would be entirely zero. We will use the term **unwrapped magnitude** to indicate a \"magnitude\" that is allowed to have negative values. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Nuisance 7: Spikes between $\\pi$ and $-\\pi$\n",
    "Since $\\pi$ and $-\\pi$ represent exactly the same phase shift, round-off noise can cause adjacent points in the phase to rapidly switch between the two values. As shown in the previous figure (d), this can produce sharp breaks and spikes in an otherwise smooth curve. Don't be fooled, the phase isn't really this discontinuous."

    "Now it is time to put everything you have learned into a class called `FourierTransform`. This class will have the following methods: `dft`, `dft_magnitude`, `dft_phase`, `arctan_correct`, `unwrap` and `frequency_domain`. Each method will have the same behavior as the functions already implemented, but now when you create an object of type Fourier with an input signal the object will have it's outputs as attributes. You can check the code below as a blue print for your class. Remember to save your class in the `Common` folder as `fourier_transform.py`."
