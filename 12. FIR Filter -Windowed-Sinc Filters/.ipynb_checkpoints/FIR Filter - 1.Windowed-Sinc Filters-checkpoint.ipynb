    "Windowed-sinc filters are used to separate one band of frequencies from another. They are very stable, produce few surprises, and can be pushed to incredible performance levels. These exceptional frequency domain characteristics are obtained at the expense of poor performance in the time domain, including excessive ripple and overshoot in the step response. When carried out by standard convolution, windowed-sinc filters are easy to program, but slow to execute.\n",

Why use 0.5 instead of the standard 0.707 (-3dB) used in analog electronics and other digital filters? This is because the windowed-sinc's frequency response is symmetrical between the passband and the stopband. For instance, the **Hamming window** results in a passband ripple of 0.2%, and an identical stopband attenuation (i.e., ripple in the stopband) of 0.2%. Other filters do not show this symmetry, and therefore have no advantage in using the one-half amplitude point to mark the cutoff frequency. This symmetry makes the windowed-sinc ideal for **spectral inversion**.\n",

    "## Example of filter design for an EEG signal\n",
    "An electroencephalogram, or EEG, is a measurement of the electrical activity of the brain. It can be detected as millivolt level signals appearing on electrodes attached to the surface of the head. Each nerve cell in the brain generates small electrical pulses. The EEG is the combined result of an enormous number of these electrical pulses being generated in a (hopefully) coordinated manner. Although the relationship between thought and this electrical coordination is very poorly understood, different frequencies in the EEG can be identified with specific mental states. If you close your eyes and relax, the predominant EEG pattern will be a slow oscillation between about 7 and 12 hertz. This waveform is called the alpha rhythm, and is associated with contentment and a decreased level of attention. Opening your eyes and looking around causes the EEG to change to the beta rhythm, occurring between about 17 and 20 hertz. Other frequencies and waveforms are seen in children, different depths of sleep, and various brain disorders such as epilepsy.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, we will assume that the EEG signal has been amplified by analog electronics, and then digitized at a sampling rate of 100 samples per second. We have a data of 640 samples. Our goal is to separate the alpha from the beta rhythms. To do this, we will design a digital low-pass filter with a cutoff frequency of 14 hertz, or 0.14 of the sampling rate. The transition bandwidth will be set at 4 hertz, or 0.04 of the sampling rate."
