    "# Statistics, Probability and Noise\n",
    "Statistics and probability are used in Digital Signal Processing to characterize signals and the processes that generate them. For example, a primary use of DSP is to reduce interference, noise, and other undesirable components in acquired data. These may be an inherent part of the signal being measured, arise from imperfections in the data acquisition system, or be introduced as an unavoidable byproduct of some DSP operation. Statistics and probability allow these disruptive features to be measured and classified."

    "## Signal and Graph Terminology\n",
    "A signal is a description of how one parameter depends on another parameter. When both parameters have a continuous range, we call this signals **continuous**, on the other hand, when both parameters have a quantized range we call these signals **discrete**. In this course we will focus on discrete signals.\n",
    "\n",
    "To keep things general, we will simply label the horizontal axis: **sample number**. If this were a continuous signal, another label would have to be used, such as: time, distance, x, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "The type of parameter on the horizontal axis is the domain of the signal. Some common domains are: **time**, **frequency** and **spatial domain**. When we just refer to **sample number** we are usually referring to time domain.\n",
    "\n",
    "The variable, $N$, is widely used in DSP to represent the total number of samples in a signal. Two notations for assigning sample numbers are commonly used. In the first notation, the sample indexes run from $1$ to $N$. In the second notation, the sample indexes run from $0$ to $N-1$. We will use the second notation since *Python* indexes start by $0$. *MATLAB* would be a good example of using the first notation."

    "## Mean and Standard Deviation\n",
    "\n",
    "The **mean** is the average value of a signal:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\mu = \\frac{1}{N}\\sum_{i=0}^{N-1}x[i]$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The **standard deviation** measure how far the signal fluctuates from the mean:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\sigma = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{N-1}\\sum_{i=0}^{N-1}(x[i]-\\mu)^2}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "It is of special interest because it fits well with the physics of how signals operate. For example, when random noise signals combine in an electronic circuit, the resultant noise is equal to the combined power of the individual signals, not their combined amplitude.\n",
    "\n",
    "The standard deviation, $\\sigma$, is a measure of **how far** the signal fluctuates from the mean. The variance, $\\sigma^2$, represents the **power** of this fluctuation.\n",
    "\n",
    "By definition, the standard deviation only measures the AC portion of a signal, while the **rms** value measures both the AC and DC components. If a signal has no DC component, its rms value is identical to its standard deviation."
